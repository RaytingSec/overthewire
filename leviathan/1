try running, notice it asks for a password. With no other given files, assume password is in binary.
scp to computer
run strings, cat, and vim
#1
    open with vim
#2
    run strings with -n 2
#3
    cat, although 's' in sex was partially blocked
string fragments, "sex" "secrf" "et" "love"
Try different ones and combinations
find "sex" is the correct password
Correct pass gives you a shell, on my own computer, doesn't seem to do anything
ssh back into leviathan, use correct password to get shell
whoami returns leviathan2 - success
cd .. to understand where you are, find dir for all other levels
cd .. again for root dir of machine
See "README.txt", open and find "Passwords for each level are stored in /etc/mygame_pass/."
cd to /etc/leviathan/ and find files for various leviathan levels, all owned by respective users
cat leviathan2 to get password

in short - run strings on check, and use the shell to navigate to password
